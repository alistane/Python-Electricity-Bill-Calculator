# Python-Electricity-Bill-Calculator
 
# Program's Working:
1.This program first takes amperes and volts of appliances and then process it and converts it into total watts
2. After Watt conversion, the program calculates kilowatt-hours 
3. Finally total cost is calculated with respect to electricity per unit price.

# Tutorial:
1.firstly program will ask you unit price in your country.
2.After this program will ask you to enter number of appliances such as number of computers, number of ac(s) etc
3.Then you will be asked to enter amps and volts of your appliances and then it will convert them into wattage so it will tell added total wattage of your appliances.
4.After wattage conversion, you will be prompted to enter how many hours you use appliances monthly.
5.The program will generate a rough estimate on how much your electricity will cost.
